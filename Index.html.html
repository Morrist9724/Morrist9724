    Welcome to a simple page meant for testing out my homework! If you love the TV show, Supernatural, as much as I do then you are in luck! Here you will see a table that ranks some of the main characters of the show (based off of my biased thoughts) and a form that allows you to give me feedback on who you like the most and the least! If you are new to this series I'm so glad you've joined us. This show is perfect for people who just need to exit their minds and enter a world full of every genre you could think of. A story that once started about two brothers who lost their mom at a young age and were raised to hunt monsters by there dad, quickly turns into a wild ride.
